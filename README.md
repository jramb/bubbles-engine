Bubbles Engine
==============

Status
------
This repository is being migrated from an internal repository.
Some code cleaning is necessary, more will follow.
Migration started in the end of 2013.

When the migration is done this will be a working implementation of the
Bubble Engine (I realize that this term needs to be explained... soon).
The Bubble Engine has been in production for over a year with good results.
Still there is some work to do.

However the goal is to provide the Bubble Engine here for others to use,
free of charge. The license question needs to be sorted out, but expect
a not very restricted open source license of some kind.


History
-------
Initially I developed the Bubbles Engine between 2010 and 2013 working
at Navigate Consulting Business Solutions (Sweden). I owe my colleagues and
bosses a great thanks for giving me the opportunity to carve out my ideas in code.
